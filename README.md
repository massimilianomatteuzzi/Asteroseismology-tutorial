# Asteroseismology-tutorial
Tutorial for the PhD course in asteroseismology at the University of Bologna.
For the lesson, one needs a working ```python3``` environment with ```jupyter-notebook``` installed (https://jupyter.org/install)

Please, before using the ```jupyter-notebook``` locally, be sure to have ```scipy```, ```plotly```, ```IPython```, ```numpy```, ```lightkurve``` and ```matplotlib``` installed in a working ```python3``` environment.

```list_objects.csv``` contains a list of stars with their effective temperatures. Please, analyse at least two of them and calculate their mass, radius, luminosity and evolutionary stage.

```RC_RGB_stars.pdf``` contains the slides of the lesson. In particular, have a look at the difference in the PSD between red giant stars with similar surface gravity but different evolutionary phase.
